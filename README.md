Using AI assistants as if they were Senior Python Developers. 
My goal here is to transform business needs and logic into programs using AI tools at their full potential.
I'm NOT a developer (just a geek that likes to implement dashboards and alerts to improve the Quality of Service and Quality of Life on his job), so see this as a "funny playground".
IMPORTANT NOTE: this is NOT a production code!
